Installation
------------

Testing the Parse PHP SDK requires having a working Parse Server instance to run against.
Additionally you'll need to add some cloud code to it.

To get started:

* [Get Composer], the PHP package manager.
* Run `composer install` to download dependencies.

From here you have to setup an instance of parse server.
For your convenience we have included a testable version of parse server as a dev dependency.

To setup the Test Parse Server:
* [Get npm], you'll need this to install the server.
* Run `npm install` from the project root to download the server and it's dependencies.
* When you're ready to run tests use `npm start` from the project root to boot up the test server.

The embedded test server utilizes this [parse server test] project.
It's setup with the appropriate configuration to run the php sdk test suite.
Additionally it handles setting up mongodb for the server.

If you have specific needs and would like to alter your test server you can fork and modify the aforementioned test project.
Alternately you can configure a compatible test server as follows:

* [Setup a local Parse Server instance]
* Add main.js in tests/cloudcode/cloud/ to your Parse Server configuration as a cloud code file
* Ensure your App ID, REST API Key, and Master Key match those contained in tests/Parse/Helper.php
* Add a mock push configuration, for example:
```json
{
    "android":
    {
        "senderId": "blank-sender-id",
        "apiKey": "not-a-real-api-key"
    }
}
```
* Add a mock email adapter configuration, for example:
```json
{
    "module": "parse-server-simple-mailgun-adapter",
    "options": {
        "apiKey": "not-a-real-api-key",
        "domain": "example.com",
        "fromAddress": "example@example.com"
    }
}
```
* Ensure the public url is correct. For a locally hosted instance this is probably ```http://localhost:1337/parse```


You should now be able to execute the tests, from project root folder:

    ./vendor/bin/phpunit

You may also run tests directly using phpunit as follows:

    npm test

Make sure your code is linted with phpcs ([PSR-2 Coding Style]):

    npm run lint

You can automatically fix lint errors with phpcbf:

    npm run lint:fix
    
Finally verify that your new changes are acceptable to phpdoc:

    npm run document-check

The test suite is setup for code coverage if you have [XDebug] installed and setup.
Coverage is outputted as text and as html in the phpunit-test-results/ directory within the project root.

If you do not have XDebug tests will still run, just without coverage.

Please make sure that any new functionality (or issues) you are working on are covered by tests when possible.
If you have XDebug setup and can view code coverage please ensure that you do your best to completely cover any new code you are adding.
